# 🏦 Terminal-Based ATM Management System

A C-based **ATM Simulation System** designed to manage user accounts with operations like registration, login, transactions, ownership transfers, interest calculations, and more. This project uses **SQLite** for data persistence and provides a clean Terminal UI experience with robust input validation.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. 👤 User Registration
- Users can **register** with a unique username and password.
- **Username must be unique** – duplicate usernames are rejected.
- Passwords are stored **(optionally encrypted)**.
- User data is stored securely in a database file.

---

### 2. 🔐 User Authentication
- Login system with **3 attempts** allowed.
- Credentials are checked against a persistent **SQLite database**.

---

### 3. 📝 Update Account Information
- Users can update:
  - **Country**
  - **Phone Number**
- The update requires:
  - Account ID input
  - Field selection
  - New value input (validated)
- Changes are persisted into the database.

---

### 4. 📋 View Account Details
- Users can **view individual account** information by inputting the account ID.
- Account types and interest rules:
  - `savings` → 💰 7% interest
  - `fixed01` → 💰 4% interest (1-year)
  - `fixed02` → 💰 5% interest (2-year)
  - `fixed03` → 💰 8% interest (3-year)
  - `current` → ❌ No interest
- Interest display is shown in a human-readable format, e.g.:
  > “You will get $5.97 as interest on day 10 of every month”

---

### 5. 💳 Transactions (Deposit & Withdraw)
- Only allowed for:
  - `savings`
  - `current`
- Prohibited for:
  - `fixed01`, `fixed02`, `fixed03`
- Updated balances are saved after each transaction.
- Invalid inputs or insufficient balances are handled gracefully.

---

### 6. ❌ Remove Account
- Users can remove an account **they own**.
- Requires confirmation: `Are you sure? (y/n)`
- Validates ownership and existence before deletion.

---

### 7. 🔄 Transfer Ownership
- Allows users to transfer an account to **another existing user**.
- Requires:
  - Account ID
  - New owner’s username
- Ownership change is reflected in the database.
- Validates:
  - Ownership
  - New username existence

#### ⚡ Bonus: Real-time Transfer Notification
> Using **pipes and child processes**, when one user transfers an account, the recipient is **instantly notified** in their terminal if logged in.

---

### 🧪 Additional Features (Bonus)
- 🔐 **Password Encryption**
- 🖼️ **Terminal UI Enhancements**
- 🧰 **Makefile** support for build automation
- 🗃️ **SQLite Database Integration** (instead of plain text files)
- 🧼 Proper **input validation**, **error handling**, and **memory management**
